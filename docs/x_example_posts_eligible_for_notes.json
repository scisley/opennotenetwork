Why exactly did the Attorney General think that was in the public interest?\n\nMeanwhile, former Labour councillor Ricky Jones called for protestors to have their throats slit. Charged with encouraging violent disorder, he pleaded not guilty and was acquitted by a jury who saw his words as a disgusting remark made in the heat of the moment, not a call to action. \n\nJuries are a cornerstone of justice, but we shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on them to protect basic freedoms. \n\nProtecting people from words should not be given greater weight in law than public safety.
